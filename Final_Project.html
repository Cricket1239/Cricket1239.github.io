    Gem Quest is a short adventure and lightweight puzzle game. You play as a theif girl who's broken into a castle to secure some treasure. <br><br>
    The game itself is quite simple, as it was designed to be easily expanded upon. Use the left and right arrow keys to move the theif. <br> 
    You'll find your path blocked by a creature, luckily for you somebody left a sword nearby. Move close to it and click on it to obtain <br> 
    the sword! Now you're able to get past that monster. Now make your way through the castle and obtain that treasure! <br><br>
    If you're stumped on what to do next, try traveling to the edge of the screen (To the right for screen one and to the left for screen two).<br>
    You're able to transition between both screens. And remember, some objects will only work when you're near them. Now don't forget to escape <br>
    through the gate when you've claimed your prize!
